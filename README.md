About

*Trigger* is a Firefox OS app for remotely triggering the shutters of cameras
connected by [PTP/IP][1].

Check [Firefox Markteplace][2].


Development
===========

Grunt
-----

Run [Grunt][3] to create the package for distribution on Firefox Marketplace.

Coding conventions
------------------

  * Code needs to validate with JSLint.

  * Comments are in Markdown.

  * Avoid constructors (JS is classless), donâ€™t throw exceptions (not necessary
    in JS).

  * Versioning: major.minor.bug-fix

    Incompatible changes to the API mandate an update of the major version.

    Keep version up to date in:

      + Git tags

      + `package.json`

      + `bower.json`
